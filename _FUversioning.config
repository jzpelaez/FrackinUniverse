  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.367^reset;
  
  -- Crafting --
  * Nuclear Core now has two recipes, and both have changed requirements. Rather than unstable particles, they now require either enriched uranium or enriched plutonium. This should help incentivize experimenting with better stations.
  * Elder Fluid is now known as Essentia Obscura
  * Turning Liquid Irradium into Irradium Bars via Chem Lab now requires Titanium in addition to the liquid
  * Bane Spear now required Irradium Ore, not Liquid Irradium
  * Irradium Rifle and Spear recipes adjusted to use more Irradium Bars
  
  -- Madness --
  * A new recipe for Tritium, available in furnaces, can be unlocked via the Particle Entropy node
  
  -- Bugs --
  * Mech Hunting Laser should properly act as a hunting weapon (Rylasasin)
  * Phaser should properly list as Electric damage in its tooltip
  
  -- Other --
  * Corrected typos on Masters Set (Argentip)
  * Added missing uranium ore to EES Transmutation study list
  * Plutonium and Enriched Plutonium are slightly better fuels
  * To make it a bit less useless in the end-game, Liquid Irradium can now function as a weak fuel (twice as efficient as Erchius). This also applies as Mech fuel.
  * Dark Cavern loot pool significantly reduced. This should hopefully reduce cases where inventories were too full, resulting in dropped items. Actual number of lootable chests remains the same.
  * adjusted look of Cute weapons, armor and craftables (Gainem)
  * Pharitu name gen has been updated and adjusted (Robur Velvetclaw)

  -- Ship Travel --
  To compensate for shorter travel times in 1.4.4 of Starbound, fuel costs have been updated:
  * all jumps between systems consume a minimum guaranteed fuel cost to represent the burst required to reach sufficient velocity.
    This value is as follows: Short Range 50, Mid Range 150, Mid-Long Range 300, Long Range 600.
  * fuel cost math is now (distance) * (mass + modifier)
  * long range fuel costs modifier is 10
  * medium-long fuel cost modifier is 6
  * medium range fuel cost modifier is 4
  * short range fuel cost modifier is 2
  * long-distance fuel costs are uncapped to 999999
  
  -- Other --
  * Fixed typo in all resistance collars (XDGrangerDX)
